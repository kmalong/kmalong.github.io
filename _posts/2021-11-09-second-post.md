title: Creating a Cool Blog
---

First off, I love this class. It teaches me a lot of cool new things about the internet and electronic devices that I have never known before. That being said, however, I also hate this class. Coding can be so hard to grasp at times that I am so glad I will not be doing this for a living. Although, I will say that when you do figure something out, it feels really good. It reminds me of this ![meme](https://knowyourmeme.com/photos/1759340-meme-man-wurds-stonks-edits).

The task of this lab was to use the Github page you created last week and customize it. Last week I had trouble getting the repository to work on Visual Studio Code and that was stressful in and of itself but alas we move forward. I was determined to figure this ish out. As I was reading through the lab it felt simple enough. I created an about me page and chose a theme and created the layouts folder that I needed. But then came the main task of customizing my webpage to make it my own. 

Initially, it felt like everything was going smooth. I chose the built in hacker theme because why wouldn't you choose the theme for an assignment dealing with html and css. It just felt fitting. I loaded up my new website and it looked decent but plain. I still needed to customize and edit the css to make it my own. I had no idea where to start or what I even needed to do. I read the articles provided in lab and searched up tips and tricks on the internet. I found some pretty helpful sites that dealt with how customizing themes in github which had very detailed step by step instructions. I read them twice to make sure I understood and then I set off to work. I created the css file in my repository and copy and pasted the code and went about writing all the variables I wanted. When I felt satisfied, I committed the changes and waited patiently for my new page to load. And... nothing. Nothing changed. At this point it was very late into the evening and I had been staring at my computer for hours, screaming into my couch pillows every so often to release some frustration. I was ready to give up. But then I decided to rewatch the lecture to see if I could figure it out. In the lecture, I saw that VS Code could be used to create the css file so I thoight "Ok, maybe I should try it here." So I did. I followed every single step hoping to get the results. And you know what happened next? You guessed it, nothing happened. The page looked the same. I was frustrated. What the heck was I doing wrong? And then I thought, "Maybe it's the theme." This is when I decided to go back and change the theme to Cayman to see if I had any better luck that way. But, once again, nothing. At this point i looked like ![this](https://tenor.com/view/kid-tired-monday-mood-lazy-gif-8853358.gif) so I decided to call it a night and try again tomorrow.

The next morning, I was determined to get this thing right. I did some more research and rewatched the lectures and set to work. I realized I could probably edit the page directly from my own github developer screen and I wondered why I never thought to try this before. I was so happy to see that the changes I wanted were finally showing up and in real time. But thats the funny thing about life isn't it? Sometimes it just doesn't want you to win. And let me tell you, this lab did not want me to win. The changes did not save. The hours of my work gone again and I could not for the life of me figure out how to make the darn thing save the changes I made. After disassociating for five minutes and questioning all my life choices, I decided it was just time to take that L. I'll try again another time but for right now I just want to watch true crime and cry over a bowl of ramen. And this is exactly why I am a Psychology major.

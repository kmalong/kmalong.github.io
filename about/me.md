This page is about me!

Hi my name is Kara. I'm a senior at Texas A&M University pursuing a Bachelor's of Science in Psychology and minoring in English. In my free time I love to watch anime and read. I also like to spend my time scrolling tiktok to fill the void. Below I will include some of the things that make me happy the most.

Here are some of my favorite memes:

This is my most favorite video of all time on the internet. I don't know why. I can't explain it. It just brings me joy from soul crushing ether that is life.
